## Decisions

### TailwindCSS

I chose to use TailwindCSS because one of the things I don't like about Angular is how a component is spread out across 3 files. Using Tailwind removes one of these. I also like the utility-first approach to styling.

### Eslint & Prettier

I like consistency in coding style and these tools help with that. These are currently the most popular tools for this purpose.
